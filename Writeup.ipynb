    "### Design and Test a Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the \"Stand Out Suggestions\" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step, I decided to convert the images to grayscale because it can get rid of the noise information caused by different color space. Grayscale simplifies the algorithm and reduces computational requirements due to one dimensional space. Indeed, color may be of limited benefit in many applications and introducing unnecessary information could increase the amount of training data required to achieve good performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a traffic sign image before and after grayscaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image2]\n",
    "\n",
    "As a last step, I normalized the image data because if we didn't scale our input training vectors, the ranges of our distributions of feature values would likely be different for each feature.We'd like in the process of backpropagation for each feature to have a similar range so that our gradients don't go out of control. Without normalization, it is is non-ideal as we might find ourselves in a oscillating (unable to center onto a better maxima in cost(weights) space) state or in a slow moving (traveling too slow to get to a better maxima) state.\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to generate additional data because more data will reduce the effect of overfitting and improve the prediction accuracy of the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "To add more data to the the data set, Initially I used the following techniques: \n",
    "* Brightness Adjustment\n",
    "* Rotation\n",
    "* Translation\n",
    "* Shear\n",
    "\n",
    "However, I just got a kind of low validation accuracy aroung 80%-90% since the more changes in the image dataset the far from generalization as I have fewer data to support that kind of spread in data augmentation. Followed the advise from the Forum mentor, I just did brightness adjust ment and rotation for my final testing, which gave me pretty impressively good result of validation accuracy and training accuracy.\n",

    "#### 4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "My final model results were:\n",
    "* training set accuracy of 0.995\n",
    "* validation set accuracy of 0.965\n",
    "* test set accuracy of 0.947\n",
    "\n",
    "If an iterative approach was chosen:\n",
    "* What was the first architecture that was tried and why was it chosen?\n",
    "\n",
    "The first architecture is the same as LeNet because it was kind of shallow ConNet and it is very easy to understand and implement. From the LeNet Solution, this architecture also did a good job in the MNIST data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "* What were some problems with the initial architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "It caused the problem of overfitting and low validation accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "* How was the architecture adjusted and why was it adjusted? Typical adjustments could include choosing a different model architecture, adding or taking away layers (pooling, dropout, convolution, etc), using an activation function or changing the activation function. One common justification for adjusting an architecture would be due to overfitting or underfitting. A high accuracy on the training set but low accuracy on the validation set indicates over fitting; a low accuracy on both sets indicates under fitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only thing I adjusted is to add dropout for first two fully connected layer, which contributes to reducing the effect of the overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Which parameters were tuned? How were they adjusted and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning rate: Initially the learning rate I chosen is 0.001 or even smaller, but it gave me low Training & Validation accuracy within 30 Epochs. I increase the learning rate since the model is learning too slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dropout: Initially I used keep_prob=0.8-1 but the larger overfitting still exists, then I tried 0.5, which improve the result. Additionally, I also tried pretty small keep_prob=0.3, it gave me a very low accuracy since it will lose most of the featured learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "* What are some of the important design choices and why were they chosen? For example, why might a convolution layer work well with this problem? How might a dropout layer help with creating a successful model?\n",
    "The data augmentation and pre-process is an important part we need to put more concentration on. Appropriate data augmentation and pre-process not only can make the performance of the model better, it can also make a great impact on reducing the overfitting. I tried only converting the dataset to grayscale but not normalized them, which would decrease both training and validation accuracy by 10% due to large variance of the images. In addition, augmentating the data properly also has a big influence on the performance. Instead of implemented all the triks such as shearing, rotation and translation, I just implemented one of them, which improve the performance of my model by over 5%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dropout definitely plays a key role in improving the effect of overfitting and reducing the computational parameter. Through experimental trial, normally dropout rate 0.4-0.6 works pretty nice to solve the problem of overfitting and also keep the high accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If a well known architecture was chosen:\n",
    "* What architecture was chosen?\n",
    "* Why did you believe it would be relevant to the traffic sign application?\n",
    "* How does the final model's accuracy on the training, validation and test set provide evidence that the model is working well?\n",
